# ControlPlane

## Overview

Control Plane is a hybrid platform enabling cloud architects to combine the services, regions, and computing power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure and any other public or private cloud to provide developers with a flexible yet unbreakable global environment for building backend apps and services.

On Control Plane, microservices can run simultaneously on any combination of cloud compute and consume any combination of cloud services without embedded credentials. The platform handles identity conveyance and authorization uniformly, utilizing best-practices/least privilege principles consistently and securely.
